# Educational-Game

## Overview:

This is an educational game designed to help younger students build the different skills they'll need in life like logical thinking, memory, literacy, and more. Within the website, each game consists of 2 small minigames that focus on these different areas.

## Technologies

This app was built mainly using React but there were several React libraries that were used for this project The most notable one is React-DnD which is a drag and drop library. For frontend, I utilized vite for setting up the server. For the backend, the website uses firebase for hosting.

## Setup

If you want to clone the repository and run it locally,  you just need to run 'npm install' in your terminal. If you do not have node or vite installed, please refer to the following docs:

https://vite.dev/guide/

However, this website is now hosted using firebase so you can access it through this link:

## Usage Guidlines

I will update this section as more user data is integrated but as of now, there isn't much you can do other than play the games.

## Known Issues/Future Enhancements

There are several known issues and future enhancements that I want to make so I will continually update this README as well as my project as a whole. But here's a list:

- Integrating user profiles and a DB through firebase to save scores.
- Fixing the drag and drop so that you can move it after placing it on to a target.
- Styling the UI so that it's more appealing to children, especially in the transitions.
- Create settings and about page.
-- Create assets I can use for visual styling.
